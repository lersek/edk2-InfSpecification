## 3.7 [Packages] Sections

These are optional sections. If there are files listed under a `[Sources]`
section, then the INF file is required to list the MdePkg/MdePkg.dec file as
the first file in a `[Packages]` section. This section is also required if the
module uses PCDs for both source and the binary "As Built" INF modules.

#### Summary

Defines the `[Packages]` section tag that is used in EDK II module INF files.
Each entry in this section contains a directory name, forward slash character
and the name of the DEC file contained in the directory name.

The order in which packages are listed may be relevant. Said order specifies in
what order include path statements are generated for a compiler. This may help
resolve header file name collisions between packages (although such collisions
are normally not expected). For setting specific include path priorities, the
packages may be listed in matching order in the INF file. Listing a package
earlier will cause a compiler to consider include paths from that package
earlier.

If there are PCDs listed in the generated "As Built" INF, the packages that
declare any PCDs must be listed in this section.

Each package filename must be listed only once per section. Package filenames
listed in architectural sections are not permitted to be listed in the common
architectural section.

The `"common"` architecture modifier in a section tag must not be combined with
other architecture type; doing so will result in a build break.

Packages listed under the `"common"` architecture section must not be listed in
sections that have other architecture modifiers.

#### Prototype

```c
<Packages>           ::= "[Packages" [<com_attrs>] "]" <EOL> <Statements>*
<com_attrs>          ::= {".common"} {<attrs>}
<attrs>              ::= <Archs> ["," <TS> "Packages" <Archs>]
<Archs>              ::= "." <arch>
<Statements>         ::= {<MacroDefinition>} {<PkgStatements>}
<PkgStatements>      ::= <TS> <Filename> [<Field2>] <EOL>
<Field2>             ::= <FS> <FeatureFlagExpress>
<FeatureFlagExpress> ::= <Boolean>
```

#### Parameters

**_Filename_**

Paths listed in the `[Packages]` section contain a directory name, forward
slash character and the name of the DEC file contained in the directory name.
Use of "..", "." and "../" in the directory path is not permitted. Use of an
absolute path is prohibited.

**_FeatureFlagExpress_**

When present, the feature flag expression determines whether the entry line is
valid. If the feature flag expression evaluates to FALSE, this entry will be
ignored by the EDK II build tools.

#### Example

```ini
[Packages]
  MdePkg/MdePkg.dec
  MdeModulePkg/MdeModulePkg.dec

[Packages.IA32]
  DEFINE CPUS = IA32FamilyCpuPkg
  $(CPUS)/DualCore/DualCore.dec
```
